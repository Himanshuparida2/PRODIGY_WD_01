            <p id="para1" class="hidden">A landing page is a single web page that visitors arrive at after clicking on a link from an external source, such as a search engine result, advertisement, social media post, or email campaign. Unlike a homepage or a multi-page website, a landing page is specifically designed to fulfill a particular objective, such as promoting a product, generating leads, or driving conversions.</p>
            <p id="para2" class="hidden">Landing pages serve as targeted entry points for visitors and are instrumental in driving conversions and achieving specific marketing goals. They provide a focused and streamlined user experience, making it easier for visitors to take the desired action and for marketers to track and measure campaign performance.</p>
